-- Getting started --

Dependencies:

 * libaio
 * libblkid
 * libkeyutils
 * liblz4
 * libscrypt
 * libsodium
 * liburcu
 * libuuid
 * libzstd
 * pkg-config
 * zlib1g
 * valgrind

Debian (Bullseye or later) and Ubuntu (20.04 or later): you can install these with
    apt install -y pkg-config libaio-dev libblkid-dev libkeyutils-dev \
        liblz4-dev libscrypt-dev libsodium-dev liburcu-dev libzstd-dev \
        uuid-dev zlib1g-dev valgrind libudev-dev

Fedora: install the "Development tools" group along with:
    dnf install -y libaio-devel libsodium-devel \
        libblkid-devel libzstd-devel zlib-devel userspace-rcu-devel \
        lz4-devel libuuid-devel valgrind-devel keyutils-libs-devel \
        libscrypt-devel findutils

Arch: install bcachefs-tools-git from the AUR.
Or to build from source, install libscrypt from the AUR along with,
    pacman -S base-devel libaio keyutils libsodium liburcu zstd valgrind

Then, just make && make install


-- Experimental features --

Experimental fuse support is currently disabled by default. Fuse support is at
an early stage and may corrupt your filesystem, so it should only be used for
testing. To enable, you'll also need to add:

* libfuse3 >= 3.7

On Debian/Ubuntu (Bullseye/20.04 or later needed for libfuse >= 3.7):
    apt install -y libfuse3-dev

On Fedora (32 or later needed for lbifuse >= 3.7):
    dnf install -y fuse3-devel

Arch:
    pacman -S fuse3

Then, make using the BCACHEFS_FUSE environment variable (make clean first if
previously built without fuse support):

BCACHEFS_FUSE=1 make && make install


-- Tests --

Some tests are available to validate the "bcachefs" binary.  The tests depend
on python3 pytest.

On debian:
    apt install -u python3-pytest

Then, you can run the tests via:

    make check
    # or if pytest has a different name
    make check PYTEST=pytest

Optionally, you may wish to run tests in parallel using python3-pytest-xdist:

    cd tests; pytest-3 -n4
